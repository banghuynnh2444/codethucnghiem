Data mining is performed to discover the relevant features of the gear vibrations, and dimensionality reduction is used to select the most significant features. Finally, LLTSA is used to build a recognition model based on the extracted features. The proposed method effectively captures the degradation characteristics of planetary gears and provides an accurate recognition of the gear's state. This research provides a valuable contribution to the field of gear degradation recognition, and further research can be conducted to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.\n"

The approach is centered on the use of supervised learning algorithms to train models with radio frequency data that can help to understand and identify different fault states. One of the key features of the method is the way it selectively chooses samples to train the models, based on their level of uncertainty and complexity. This is achieved through the application of a complexity theory-inspired approach that seeks to balance the trade-off between model accuracy and computational efficiency. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches in terms of both diagnostic accuracy and computational efficiency. In summary, this paper provides a novel approach to fault diagnosis that combines the strengths of supervised learning, uncertainty, and complexity theory to improve the performance of diagnosis systems.\n"

Such visual distortions may negatively affect the performance of the system. One such bad weather condition is rain, which randomly makes intensity fluctuations in the images. This paper proposes a new low rank recovery based algorithm to remove the rain streaks from single image taken in rainy weather. This method makes the use of weighted nuclear norm (WNN) and total variation (TV) regularization for efficient rain removal. WNN assigns different weights to different singular values based on the details each singular value holds. TV regularization is used to discriminate most of natural image content from sparse rain streaks by preserving piecewise smoothness of images. Simulation result shows that the rain streaks are more efficaciously eliminated by our method.\n"

In bilingual communities, the speakers commonly embed the words and phrases of a non-native language into the syntax of a native language in their day-to-day communications. The code-switching is a global phenomenon among multilingual communities, still very limited acoustic and linguistic resources are available as yet. For developing effective speech-based applications, the ability of the existing language technologies to deal with the code-switched data cannot be over emphasized. The code-switching is broadly classified into two modes: inter-sentential and intra-sentential code-switching. In this work, we have studied the intrasentential problem in the context of code-switching language modeling task. The salient contributions of this paper includes: (i) the creation of Hindi-English code-switching text corpus by crawling a few blogging sites educating about the usage of the Internet, and (ii) the exploration of the parts-of-speech features towards more effective modeling of Hindi-English code-switched data by the monolingual language models trained on native (Hindi) language data.\n"

In this study, an innovative AI-generated text detection model is constructed based on the BERT algorithm, which provides a novel solution for this field. In thedatapreprocessing stage, a series of steps were taken, including operations such as converting text tolowercase, performing word splitting, removing stop words, stemming extraction, and eliminatingnumbers and redundant spaces. By dividing the dataset into training and test sets in the ratio of 60%and 40%, we observe that the accuracy rate grows from the initial 94.78%to 99.72%duringthetraining process, which indicates that the BERT model is able to detect the AI-generated text withhighaccuracy; at the same time, the loss value decreases from the initial 0.261 to 0.021 and tends tobestable, and the model's prediction results are gradually close to the real classification results. Further analysis of the results of the training and test sets shows that the average loss of the trainingset is 0.0565, while the average loss of the test set is 0.0917, which shows that the test set has a slight upward trend relative to the training set. In terms of accuracy, the average accuracy of the trainingset reaches 98.1%, while the average accuracy of the test set is 97.71%, with only a 0.39%differencebetween the two. This indicates that the model has good generalisation ability and can achieve highaccuracy on unknown data. In conclusion, the AI-generated text detection model based on BERT algorithmproposedinthisstudy performs well after sufficient training. By effectively processing and reasonably dividingthedata and combining with excellent deep learning algorithms, it has achieved remarkable results inthefield of AI-generated text detection.

      ">> Nhập văn bản:  When we look up at the night sky, one object often outshines all the stars. It is Venus, known as the \"Morning Star\" or the \"Evening Star.\" Named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty, this planet has captivated human imagination for millennia. However, modern science has revealed a startling contrast: while Venus looks beautiful from afar, up close it is a hellish world. It is often called Earth’s \"evil twin\"—a planet that started with similar ingredients to our own but evolved into a toxic inferno.  The Sister Planet In terms of size and structure, Venus is remarkably similar to Earth.  Size: It has a diameter of about 12,104 kilometers, only slightly smaller than Earth.  Composition: It is a rocky planet with an iron core and a silicate mantle.  Gravity: Its gravity is about 90% of Earth's, meaning you would feel almost the same weight standing there.  Because of these similarities, astronomers believe that billions of years ago, Venus might have been a habitable world with liquid water oceans. However, a catastrophic chain of events changed its destiny forever.  The Runaway Greenhouse Effect The defining characteristic of Venus is its terrifying atmosphere. It is the hottest planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to the Sun. This is due to a phenomenon known as the runaway greenhouse effect.  The atmosphere is extremely dense, consisting of 96% carbon dioxide. This thick blanket of gas traps heat from the Sun and prevents it from escaping back into space. Consequently, the average surface temperature is a scorching 475°C (900°F)—hot enough to melt lead.  Furthermore, the atmospheric pressure on the surface is crushing. Standing on Venus would feel like being 900 meters (3,000 feet) underwater on Earth. To make matters worse, the planet is shrouded in thick clouds of sulfuric acid, which rain down virga (rain that evaporates before hitting the ground).  A World in Retrograde Venus behaves differently from most other planets in its motion.  Retrograde Rotation: Venus spins in the opposite direction to Earth. On Venus, the Sun rises in the west and sets in the east.  The Long Day: It rotates incredibly slowly. One day on Venus (one full rotation) takes 243 Earth days, while one year (orbit around the Sun) takes only 225 Earth days. This means a day on Venus is actually longer than its year!  The Surface and Exploration Because of the thick clouds, we cannot see the surface through simple telescopes. We rely on radar mapping and daring space probes to understand the landscape.  The surface of Venus is dominated by volcanic activity. It is covered in vast plains of solidified lava, thousands of volcanoes, and large impact craters. The highest mountain, Maxwell Montes, stands taller than Mount Everest.  Exploring this surface has been one of the hardest challenges in space history. Between the 1960s and 1980s, the Soviet Union sent a series of Venera probes to land on the planet. These represent the only times humans have successfully transmitted photos from the surface. However, the conditions are so hostile that the longest-surviving lander, Venera 13, lasted only 127 minutes before succumbing to the heat and pressure.  Conclusion: A Warning for Earth Venus remains a subject of intense study, not just for curiosity, but for survival. It serves as a cautionary tale for Earth. By studying the extreme greenhouse effect on Venus, scientists hope to better understand climate change on our own planet.  While it may not be the paradise of \"love and beauty\" that the ancients imagined, Venus is scientifically invaluable. It is a stunning, dangerous, and complex world that reminds us just how fragile and precious the habitable conditions of Earth truly are.\n"
